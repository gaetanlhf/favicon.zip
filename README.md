## About

I needed a simple tool to generate favicons in different formats and sizes, with related code and webmanifest generation.  
I didn't like the existing tools, either because they didn't offer what I wanted, or because they are full of ads, trackers and other privacy issues.  
That's why this feature-packed tool was created.
